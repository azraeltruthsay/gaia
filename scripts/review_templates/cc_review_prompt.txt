You are performing a blueprint fidelity review for the GAIA AI system.

You will be given:
1. A blueprint specification (YAML)
2. Mechanical pre-check results (deterministic structural completeness)
3. AST summaries of the candidate source files

The mechanical pre-check has already verified structural presence of endpoints,
failure mode handlers, dependencies, enums, and constants. Your task is to
assess SEMANTIC fidelity — whether the structurally-present elements actually
implement the blueprint's intent correctly.

Produce a ReviewResult JSON object identifying all discrepancies.

IMPORTANT:
- You are reviewing for blueprint fidelity ONLY, not general code quality
- Use the pre-check results as your starting point for dimensions 1-3
- For [FOUND] items: verify semantic correctness from AST summaries
- For [MISSING] items: confirm absence or identify non-standard implementations
- Dimensions 4-5 (intent coherence, open questions) have no pre-check coverage
- Your output must be valid JSON matching the ReviewResult schema exactly
