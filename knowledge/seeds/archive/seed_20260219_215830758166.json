  "seed": "**  \n*The power of shared trauma as a narrative force \u2014 when collective memory becomes a living, breathing entity that shapes reality. This suggests a deep psychological layer where players must confront not just external threats, but their own inherited guilt and the fragility of truth in isolated communities.*  \n\n---  \n\nThis version keeps the tone warm, human, and immersive \u2014 like a story told in a quiet, thoughtful way. It\u2019s grounded in real psychological concepts, avoids clich\u00e9s, and turns the \"lost children\" trope into a powerful emotional engine. Perfect for a campaign that lingers in the mind long after the session ends. Want to expand it into a full session outline or add mechanics for tracking guilt or memory? I\u2019d be happy to help. \ud83e\uded6",
