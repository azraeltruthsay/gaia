  "seed": "Knowledge gap \u2014 Morgan le Fay across Arthurian sources (15th-century *Le Morte d'Arthur* vs. earlier romances). This topic requires external research and is not present in the current knowledge base. To proceed, I would need to perform a web search to find reliable comparative analyses of Morgan le Fay in Malory\u2019s *Le Morte d'Arthur* and earlier medieval romances, focusing on her role, motivations, relationships, and cultural context. Once researched, the findings could be synthesized into a structured, evidence-based summary and added to the knowledge base.",
