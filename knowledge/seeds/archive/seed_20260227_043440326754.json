  "seed": "Knowledge gap \u2014 long-term stability of data partition migration under BlueShot exposure. Current documentation lacks data on partition integrity, migration, or boundary compromise during cognitive interference. This gap is critical for improving system resilience and operational transparency under stress. The gap will be addressed through targeted simulation, log analysis, and future diagnostic tooling. ---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nTo close this gap, the system should:\n- Execute `introspect_logs` with filters for \"BlueShot\", \"cognitive overload\", \"data partition\", or \"memory access\" to search for any undocumented anomalies. - Conduct a controlled simulation or narrative test where BlueShot exposure is triggered, and data partition behavior is monitored. - Once data is collected, update `/knowledge/projects/dnd-campaign/core-documentation/gaia_system_status_update.md` or create a new document on data partition stability under cognitive stress. Until then, the system's behavior during BlueShot exposure is known to be resilient at the operational level, but **data-level stability remains unverified**.",
