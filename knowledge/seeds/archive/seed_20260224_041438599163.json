  "seed": "Knowledge gap \u2014 Excalibur\u2019s portrayal across Arthurian legends and D&D campaigns. This topic requires a detailed comparative analysis of primary medieval texts (Geoffrey of Monmouth, Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, Malory) and secondary fictional works (e.g., Forgotten Realms, Dark Sun). The information is not currently in the knowledge base. Could be researched and added to knowledge base via web_search and curated reference integration. Recommendation: Use a web_search to gather authoritative sources on Excalibur\u2019s mythological and fictional portrayals, then synthesize them into a structured entry with clear subsections on origin, symbolism, regional variations, and D&D adaptations. Cite each source with bibliographic details and distinguish between historical and fictional content.",
