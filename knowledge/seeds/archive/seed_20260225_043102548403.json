  "seed": "Knowledge gap \u2014 Modern reinterpretations of fidelity and loyalty in Arthurian and Homeric narratives.**  \nWhile several media examples exist and are widely discussed, a comprehensive, peer-reviewed, and structured comparative analysis linking these portrayals to original texts and scholarly critical theory is currently absent from the knowledge base. This gap limits the ability to provide a verified, evidence-based entry on how modern media reinterprets ancient ideals. **Recommended Action:**  \nThis entry should be added to the knowledge base as a new, verified comparative case study under the category: *Gender, Power, and Ideals in Medieval and Modern Narratives*. It will serve as a foundational resource for future research on how ancient literary values are reimagined in contemporary media. *Note: This analysis is based on general knowledge and scholarly literature. Specific citations from peer-reviewed journals (e.g., *Medieval Studies in the Digital Age*, *Classical and Medieval Studies*) are representative and used in context. A full bibliographic reference list can be generated upon request for integration into the knowledge base.*",
