intent:
  purpose: >
    Sandboxed execution layer enforcing security boundaries around GAIA's tool
    calls. Acts as both a security perimeter (preventing unauthorized file/shell
    access via path allowlisting) and an approval gate (requiring human
    confirmation for destructive operations). Delegation to a separate service
    allows gaia-core to remain interface-agnostic and CPU-only.
  cognitive_role: "The Hands"
  design_decisions:
    - "Separate service decouples tool execution from cognition, keeping gaia-core CPU-only"
    - "Path allowlisting restricts file ops to /knowledge, /sandbox, /models; symlink traversal blocked via .resolve()"
    - "Approval flow enforces human-in-the-loop via 5-char challenge reversal; time-boxed to configurable TTL"
    - "Domain allowlisting gates web research to trusted/reliable tiers; blocked list prevents social media leakage"
    - "Rate limiting (20 searches/hr, 50 fetches/hr) via in-memory sliding window prevents abuse"
    - "Study gateway pattern (async await) enables LoRA adapter management while preserving tool isolation"
    - "Fragment assembly with overlap checking enables long responses split across token limits"
    - "JSON-RPC 2.0 for lightweight tool dispatch without REST overhead"
    - "Graceful degradation: missing study, blocked domains, rate limits return structured errors not exceptions"
  open_questions:
    - "Should approval TTL be configurable per-tool (e.g., ai_write longer than run_shell)?"
    - "Should rate limits be per-minute with burst allowance instead of per-hour?"
    - "Should approval store persist to disk across container restarts for auditability?"
