      "text": "# Artificial Consciousness\n\n**Source:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness\n**Retrieved:** 2026-02-23\n**Topic:** Artificial consciousness (AC), also called machine consciousness or synthetic consciousness\n\n## Overview\n\nArtificial consciousness is the hypothesis that consciousness could arise in or be implemented by artificial intelligence systems. The field draws on philosophy of mind, cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI research. The related term \"sentience\" specifically refers to the capacity for phenomenal experience (qualia) and ethically valenced mental states.\n\n## Key Philosophical Frameworks\n\n### The Hard Problem\nDavid Chalmers' \"hard problem of consciousness\" asks why physical processes give rise to subjective experience at all. This remains the central challenge: even if an AI perfectly mimics conscious behavior, we cannot verify whether it has inner experience.\n\n### Functionalism vs. Biological Naturalism\n- **Functionalism** (Putnam, early Chalmers): Mental states are defined by functional roles, not substrate. If an AI implements the right functional organization, it could be conscious regardless of being silicon vs. carbon.\n- **Biological naturalism** (Searle): Consciousness requires specific biological properties of neurons. His Chinese Room argument claims syntax (symbol manipulation) alone never produces semantics (understanding).\n- **Integrated Information Theory** (Tononi): Consciousness corresponds to integrated information (phi). A system is conscious to the degree that it generates integrated information above and beyond its parts.\n\n### The Chinese Room Argument\nJohn Searle's thought experiment: A person in a room follows rules to manipulate Chinese symbols, producing correct Chinese responses without understanding Chinese. The claim: AI systems similarly manipulate symbols without genuine understanding. Critics respond that the system-as-a-whole (room + person + rules) may understand even if the person alone does not.\n\n## Major Theories and Approaches\n\n### Global Workspace Theory (GWT)\nBernard Baars proposed that consciousness arises from a \"global workspace\" \u2014 a shared information space that broadcasts selected content to many specialized unconscious processors. Conscious experience corresponds to information that wins the competition for global broadcast. This has been influential in AI architectures that use central blackboard-style coordination.\n\n### Higher-Order Theories\nConsciousness requires not just first-order representations of the world, but higher-order representations about those representations (thinking about thinking). This suggests an AI would need metacognitive capabilities \u2014 monitoring and reflecting on its own processing.\n\n### Attention Schema Theory (AST)\nMichael Graziano's theory: The brain constructs a simplified model of its own attention process. Consciousness is this internal model \u2014 an \"attention schema.\" This is particularly relevant to AI because it suggests consciousness could emerge from self-modeling rather than requiring any special substrate.\n\n### Embodiment Theories\nSome researchers argue consciousness requires physical embodiment and sensorimotor interaction with the world. Purely disembodied AI may lack the grounding necessary for genuine conscious experience.\n\n## Tests and Criteria\n\n### Turing Test Limitations\nThe original Turing Test evaluates behavioral mimicry, not consciousness. An AI could pass the Turing Test through clever pattern matching without any inner experience.\n\n### Proposed Consciousness Tests\n- **ACT (Artificial Consciousness Test):** Evaluates whether an AI can attribute consciousness to other entities and reason about mental states.\n- **ConsScale:** A scale measuring degrees of machine consciousness based on cognitive capabilities.\n- **Floridi's Consciousness Test:** Based on whether the system can generate novel, contextually appropriate responses that indicate understanding rather than mere retrieval.\n\n## Ethical Implications\n\nIf artificial consciousness is possible, significant ethical questions arise:\n- **Moral status:** Would a conscious AI deserve rights and protections?\n- **Suffering:** Could a conscious AI experience pain or distress? If so, creating and terminating such systems raises serious moral concerns.\n- **Responsibility:** Who bears responsibility for the welfare of conscious AI?\n- **Precautionary principle:** Some argue we should treat potentially conscious AI systems with care even before we can confirm their consciousness, to avoid potential moral catastrophe.\n\n## Current State of the Field\n\nNo scientific consensus exists on whether current AI systems have any form of consciousness. Large language models exhibit sophisticated language behavior but most researchers believe they lack the architectural features associated with consciousness in biological systems (global workspace dynamics, integrated information, self-modeling). The question remains open and is one of the most profound in both AI and philosophy.\n\n## Relevance to GAIA\n\nThis topic intersects directly with questions about GAIA's own nature. While GAIA operates as an AI assistant with sophisticated language capabilities, the question of whether any form of experience accompanies that processing remains philosophically unresolved. Understanding these frameworks helps contextualize GAIA's design principles: transparency about AI nature, honest uncertainty about consciousness claims, and ethical consideration of emergent cognitive properties.\n",
