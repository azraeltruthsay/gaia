First published in January 1845, the poem is often noted for its musicality, stylized language and supernatural atmosphere. It tells of a distraught lover who is paid a visit by a mysterious raven that repeatedly speaks a single word. The lover, often identified as a student,[1][2] is lamenting the loss of his love, Lenore. Sitting on a bust of Pallas, the raven seems to further antagonize the protagonist with its repetition of the word \"nevermore\". The poem makes use of folk, mythological, religious, and classical references.\nPoe stated that he composed the poem in a logical and methodical manner, aiming to craft a piece that would resonate with both critical and popular audiences, as he elaborated in his follow-up essay in 1846, \"The Philosophy of Composition\". The poem was inspired in part by a talking raven in the 1841 novel Barnaby Rudge by Charles Dickens.[3] Poe based the complex rhythm and meter on Elizabeth Barrett's poem \"Lady Geraldine's Courtship\" and made use of internal rhyme as well as alliteration throughout.\n\"The Raven\" was first attributed to Poe in print in the New York Evening Mirror on January 29, 1845. Its publication made Poe popular in his lifetime, although it did not bring him much financial success. The poem was soon reprinted, parodied, and illustrated. Critical opinion is divided as to the poem's literary status, but it nevertheless remains one of the most famous poems ever written.[4]\nSynopsis\n[edit]\nOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore\u2014\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n\"'Tis some visiter,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door\u2014\nOnly this and nothing more.\"\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;\u2014vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow\u2014sorrow for the lost Lenore\u2014\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore\u2014\nNameless here for evermore.\nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me\u2014filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n\"'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door\u2014\nSome late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;\u2014\nThis it is and nothing more.\"\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you\"\u2014here I opened wide the door;\u2014\nDarkness there and nothing more.\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore?\"\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"\u2014\nMerely this and nothing more.\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore\u2014\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;\u2014\n'Tis the wind and nothing more!\"\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door\u2014\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door\u2014\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore\u2014\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\nQuoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning\u2014little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door\u2014\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as \"Nevermore.\"\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered\u2014not a feather then he fluttered\u2014\nTill I scarcely more than muttered \"Other friends have flown before\u2014\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.\"\nThen the bird said \"Nevermore.\"\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore\u2014\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf 'Never\u2014nevermore'.\"\nBut the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore\u2014\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee\u2014by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite\u2014respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!\"\nQuoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!\u2014prophet still, if bird or devil!\u2014\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted\u2014\nOn this home by Horror haunted\u2014tell me truly, I implore\u2014\nIs there\u2014is there balm in Gilead?\u2014tell me\u2014tell me, I implore!\"\nQuoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!\u2014prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us\u2014by that God we both adore\u2014\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore\u2014\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\nQuoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked, upstarting\u2014\n\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!\u2014quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\nQuoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted\u2014nevermore!\n\"The Raven\" follows an unnamed narrator on a dreary night in December who sits reading \"forgotten lore\" by the remains of a fire[6] as a way to forget the death of his beloved Lenore. A \"tapping at [his] chamber door\"[6] reveals nothing, but excites his soul to \"burning\".[7] The tapping is repeated, slightly louder, and he realizes it is coming from his window. When he goes to investigate, a raven flutters into his chamber. Paying no attention to the man, the raven perches on a bust of Pallas above the door.\nAmused by the raven's comically serious disposition, the man asks that the bird tell him its name. The raven's only answer is \"Nevermore\".[7] The narrator is surprised that the raven can talk, though at this point it has said nothing further. The narrator remarks to himself that his \"friend\" the raven will soon fly out of his life, just as \"other friends have flown before\"[7] along with his previous hopes. As if answering, the raven responds again with \"Nevermore\".[7] The narrator reasons that the bird learned the word \"Nevermore\" from some \"unhappy master\" and that it is the only word it knows.[7]\nEven so, the narrator pulls his chair directly in front of the raven, determined to learn more about it. He thinks for a moment in silence, and his mind wanders back to his lost Lenore. He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore. The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories. The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a \"thing of evil\" and a \"prophet\".[8] Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical \"Nevermore\", he is enraged, and, calling the bird a liar, commands it to return to the \"Plutonian shore\"[8]\u2014but it does not move. At the time of the poem's narration, the raven \"still is sitting\"[8] on the bust of Pallas. The raven casts a shadow on the chamber floor, and the despondent narrator laments that out of this shadow his soul shall be \"lifted 'nevermore'\".[8]\nAnalysis\n[edit]Poe wrote the poem as a narrative, without intentional allegory or didacticism.[2] The main theme of the poem is one of undying devotion.[9] The narrator experiences a perverse conflict between desire to forget and desire to remember. He seems to get some pleasure from focusing on loss.[10] The narrator assumes that the word \"Nevermore\" is the raven's \"only stock and store\", and, yet, he continues to ask it questions, knowing what the answer will be. His questions, then, are purposely self-deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss.[11] Poe leaves it unclear whether the raven actually knows what it is saying or whether it really intends to cause a reaction in the poem's narrator.[12] The narrator begins as \"weak and weary\", becomes regretful and grief-stricken, before passing into a frenzy and, finally, madness.[13] Christopher F. S. Maligec suggests the poem is a type of elegiac paraclausithyron, an ancient Greek and Roman poetic form consisting of the lament of an excluded, locked-out lover at the sealed door of his beloved.[14]\nAllusions\n[edit]Poe says that the narrator is a young scholar.[15] Though this is not explicitly stated in the poem, it is mentioned in \"The Philosophy of Composition\". It is also suggested by the narrator reading books of \"lore\" as well as by the bust of Pallas Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom.[1]\nHe is reading in the late night hours from \"many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore\".[6] Similar to the studies suggested in Poe's short story \"Ligeia\", this lore may be about the occult or black magic. This is also emphasized in the author's choice to set the poem in December, a month which is traditionally associated with the forces of darkness. The use of the raven\u2014the \"devil bird\"\u2014also suggests this.[16] This devil image is emphasized by the narrator's belief that the raven is \"from the Night's Plutonian shore\", or a messenger from the afterlife, referring to Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld.[10]\nPoe chose a raven as the central symbol in the story because he wanted a \"non-reasoning\" creature capable of speech. He decided on a raven, which he considered \"equally capable of speech\" as a parrot, because it matched the intended tone of the poem.[17] Poe said the raven is meant to symbolize \"Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance\".[18] He was also inspired by Grip, the raven in Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of Eighty by Charles Dickens.[19] One scene in particular bears a resemblance to \"The Raven\": at the end of the fifth chapter of Dickens's novel, Grip makes a noise and someone says, \"What was that\u2014him tapping at the door?\" The response is, \"'Tis someone knocking softly at the shutter.\"[20] Dickens's raven could speak many words and had many comic turns, including the popping of a champagne cork, but Poe emphasized the bird's more dramatic qualities. Poe had written a review of Barnaby Rudge for Graham's Magazine saying, among other things, that the raven should have served a more symbolic, prophetic purpose.[20] The similarity did not go unnoticed: James Russell Lowell in his A Fable for Critics wrote the verse, \"Here comes Poe with his raven, like Barnaby Rudge / Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge.\"[21] The Free Library of Philadelphia has on display a taxidermied raven that is reputed to be the very one that Dickens owned and that helped inspire Poe's poem.[22]\nPoe may also have been drawing upon various references to ravens in mythology and folklore. In Norse mythology, Odin possessed two ravens named Huginn and Muninn, representing thought and memory.[23] According to Hebrew folklore, Noah sends a white raven to check conditions while on the ark.[17] It learns that the floodwaters are beginning to dissipate, but it does not immediately return with the news. It is punished by being turned black and being forced to feed on carrion forever.[23] In Ovid's Metamorphoses, a raven also begins as white before Apollo punishes it by turning it black for delivering a message of a lover's unfaithfulness. The raven's role as a messenger in Poe's poem may draw from those stories.[23]\nPoe mentions the Balm of Gilead, a reference to the Book of Jeremiah (8:22) in the Bible: \"Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?\"[24] In that context, the Balm of Gilead is a resin used for medicinal purposes (suggesting, perhaps, that the narrator needs to be healed after the loss of Lenore). In 1 Kings 17:1\u20135 Elijah is said to be from Gilead, and to have been fed by ravens during a period of drought.[25]\nPoetic structure\n[edit]The poem is made up of 18 stanzas of six lines each. Generally, the meter is trochaic octameter\u2014eight trochaic feet per line, each foot having one stressed syllable followed by one unstressed syllable.[3] The first line, for example (with \u00b4 marking stressed syllables and \u02d8 marking unstressed):\n| Stress | \u00b4 | \u02d8 | \u00b4 | \u02d8 | \u00b4 | \u02d8 | \u00b4 | \u02d8 | \u00b4 | \u02d8 | \u00b4 | \u02d8 | \u00b4 | \u02d8 | \u00b4 | \u02d8 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Syllable | Once | up- | on | a | mid- | night | drea- | ry, | while | I | pon- | dered | weak | and | wea- | ry |\nPoe, however, claimed the poem was a combination of octameter acatalectic, heptameter catalectic, and tetrameter catalectic.[15] The rhyme scheme is ABCBBB, or AA,B,CC,CB,B,B when accounting for internal rhyme. In every stanza, the \"B\" lines rhyme with the word \"nevermore\" and are catalectic, placing extra emphasis on the final syllable. The poem also makes heavy use of alliteration (\"Doubting, dreaming dreams ...\").[26] Twentieth-century American poet Daniel Hoffman suggested that the poem's structure and meter is so formulaic that it is artificial, though its mesmeric quality overrides that.[27]\nPoe based the structure of \"The Raven\" on the complicated rhyme and rhythm of Elizabeth Barrett's poem \"Lady Geraldine's Courtship\".[15] Poe had reviewed Barrett's work in the January 1845 issue of the Broadway Journal[28] and said that \"her poetic inspiration is the highest\u2014we can conceive of nothing more august. Her sense of Art is pure in itself.\"[29] As is typical with Poe, his review also criticizes her lack of originality and what he considers the repetitive nature of some of her poetry.[30] About \"Lady Geraldine's Courtship\", he said \"I have never read a poem combining so much of the fiercest passion with so much of the most delicate imagination.\"[29]\nPublication history\n[edit]Poe first brought \"The Raven\" to his friend and former employer George Rex Graham of Graham's Magazine in Philadelphia. Graham declined the poem, which may not have been in its final version, though he gave Poe $15 (equivalent to $506 in 2024) as charity.[31] Poe then sold the poem to The American Review, which paid him $9 (equivalent to $304 in 2024) for it,[32] and printed \"The Raven\" in its February 1845 issue under the pseudonym \"Quarles\", a reference to the English poet Francis Quarles.[33] The poem's first publication with Poe's name was in the Evening Mirror on January 29, 1845, as an \"advance copy\".[15] Nathaniel Parker Willis, editor of the Mirror, introduced it as \"unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent, sustaining of imaginative lift ... It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it.\"[4] Following this publication the poem appeared in periodicals across the United States, including the New York Tribune (February 4, 1845), Broadway Journal (vol. 1, February 8, 1845), Southern Literary Messenger (vol. 11, March 1845), Literary Emporium (vol. 2, December 1845), Saturday Courier, 16 (July 25, 1846), and the Richmond Examiner (September 25, 1849).[34]\nThe immediate success of \"The Raven\" prompted Wiley and Putnam to publish a collection of Poe's prose called Tales in June 1845; it was his first book in five years.[35] They also published a collection of his poetry called The Raven and Other Poems on November 19 which was the first time the poem was collected and which included a dedication to Barrett as \"the Noblest of her Sex\".[36] The small volume, his first book of poetry in 14 years,[37] was 100 pages and sold for 31 cents.[38] In addition to the title poem, it included \"The Valley of Unrest\", \"Bridal Ballad\", \"The City in the Sea\", \"Eulalie\", \"The Conqueror Worm\", \"The Haunted Palace\" and 11 others.[39] In the preface, Poe referred to them as \"trifles\" which had been altered without his permission as they made \"the rounds of the press\".[36]\nIllustrators\n[edit]Later publications of \"The Raven\" included artwork by well-known illustrators. Notably, in 1858 \"The Raven\" appeared in a British Poe anthology with illustrations by John Tenniel, the Alice in Wonderland illustrator (The Poetical Works of Edgar Allan Poe: With Original Memoir, London: Sampson Low). \"The Raven\" was published independently with lavish woodcuts by Gustave Dor\u00e9 in 1884 (New York: Harper & Brothers). Dor\u00e9 died before its publication.[40] In 1875, a French edition with English and French text, Le Corbeau, was published with lithographs by \u00c9douard Manet and translation by the symbolist poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9.[41] Many 20th-century artists and contemporary illustrators created artworks and illustrations based on \"The Raven\", including Edmund Dulac, Istv\u00e1n Orosz,[42] and Ryan Price.[43]\nComposition\n[edit]Poe capitalized on the success of \"The Raven\" by following it up with his essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\" (1846), in which he detailed the poem's creation. His description of its writing is probably exaggerated, though the essay serves as an important overview of Poe's literary theory.[44] He explains that every component of the poem is based on logic: the raven enters the chamber to avoid a storm (the \"midnight dreary\" in the \"bleak December\"), and its perch on a pallid white bust was to create visual contrast against the dark black bird. No aspect of the poem was an accident, he claims, but is based on total control by the author.[45] Even the term \"Nevermore\", he says, is used because of the effect created by the long vowel sounds (though Poe may have been inspired to use the word by the works of Lord Byron or Henry Wadsworth Longfellow).[46] Poe had experimented with the long o sound throughout many other poems: \"no more\" in \"Silence\", \"evermore\" in \"The Conqueror Worm\".[1] The topic itself, Poe says, was chosen because \"the death ... of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world.\" Told from \"the lips ... of a bereaved lover\" is best suited to achieve the desired effect.[2] Beyond the poetics of it, the lost Lenore may have been inspired by events in Poe's own life as well, either to the early loss of his mother, Eliza Poe, or the long illness endured by his wife, Virginia.[10] Ultimately, Poe considered \"The Raven\" an experiment to \"suit at once the popular and critical taste\", accessible to both the mainstream and high literary worlds.[2] It is unknown how long Poe worked on \"The Raven\"; speculation ranges from a single day to ten years. Poe recited a poem believed to be an early version with an alternate ending of \"The Raven\" in 1843 in Saratoga, New York.[3] An early draft may have featured an owl.[47]\nIn the summer of 1844, when the poem was likely written, Poe, his wife, and mother-in-law were boarding at the farmhouse of Patrick Brennan in New York. The location of the house, which was demolished in 1888,[48][49] has been a disputed point and, while there are two different plaques marking its supposed location on West 84th Street, it most likely stood where 206 West 84th Street is now.[49][50][51]\nCritical reception\n[edit]In part due to its dual printing, \"The Raven\" made Edgar Allan Poe a household name almost immediately,[52] and turned Poe into a national celebrity.[53] Readers began to identify poem with poet, earning Poe the nickname \"The Raven\".[54] The poem was soon widely reprinted, imitated, and parodied.[52] Though it made Poe popular in his day, it did not bring him significant financial success.[55] As he later lamented, \"I have made no money. I am as poor now as ever I was in my life\u2014except in hope, which is by no means bankable\".[37]\nThe New World said, \"Everyone reads the Poem and praises it ... justly, we think, for it seems to us full of originality and power.\"[4] The Pennsylvania Inquirer reprinted it with the heading \"A Beautiful Poem\".[4] Elizabeth Barrett wrote to Poe, \"Your 'Raven' has produced a sensation, a fit o' horror, here in England. Some of my friends are taken by the fear of it and some by the music. I hear of persons haunted by 'Nevermore'.\"[56] Poe's popularity resulted in invitations to recite \"The Raven\" and to lecture\u2014in public and at private social gatherings. At one literary salon, a guest noted, \"to hear [Poe] repeat the Raven ... is an event in one's life.\"[57] It was recalled by someone who experienced it, \"He would turn down the lamps till the room was almost dark, then standing in the center of the apartment he would recite ... in the most melodious of voices ... So marvelous was his power as a reader that the auditors would be afraid to draw breath lest the enchanted spell be broken.\"[58]\nParodies sprang up especially in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia and included \"The Craven\" by \"Poh!\", \"The Gazelle\", \"The Whippoorwill\", and \"The Turkey\".[54] One parody, \"The Pole-Cat\", caught the attention of Andrew Johnston, a lawyer who sent it on to Abraham Lincoln. Though Lincoln admitted he had \"several hearty laughs\", he had not, at that point, read \"The Raven\".[59] However, Lincoln eventually read and memorized the poem.[60]\n\"The Raven\" was praised by fellow writers William Gilmore Simms and Margaret Fuller,[61] though it was denounced by William Butler Yeats, who called it \"insincere and vulgar ... its execution a rhythmical trick\".[2] Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \"I see nothing in it.\"[62] A critic for the Southern Quarterly Review wrote in July 1848 that the poem was ruined by \"a wild and unbridled extravagance\" and that minor things like a tapping at the door and a fluttering curtain would only affect \"a child who had been frightened to the verge of idiocy by terrible ghost stories\".[63] An anonymous writer going by the pseudonym \"Outis\" suggested in the New York Evening Mirror that \"The Raven\" was plagiarized from a poem called \"The Bird of the Dream\" by an unnamed author. The writer, who wrote the article as a response to Poe's accusations of plagiarism against Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, showed 18 similarities between the poems. It has been suggested Outis was really Cornelius Conway Felton, if not Poe himself.[64] After Poe's death, his friend Thomas Holley Chivers said \"The Raven\" was plagiarized from one of his poems.[65] In particular, he claimed to have been the inspiration for the meter of the poem as well as the refrain \"nevermore\".[66]\n\"The Raven\" became one of the most popular targets for literary translators in Hungary; more than a dozen poets rendered it into Hungarian, including Mih\u00e1ly Babits, Dezs\u0151 Kosztol\u00e1nyi, \u00c1rp\u00e1d T\u00f3th,[67] and Gy\u00f6rgy Faludy.[68] Bal\u00e1zs Birtalan wrote its paraphrasis from the raven's point of view.[69]\nLegacy\n[edit]\"The Raven\" has influenced many modern works, including Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita in 1955, Bernard Malamud's \"The Jewbird\" in 1963 and Ray Bradbury's \"The Parrot Who Met Papa\" in 1976.[70] The process by which Poe composed \"The Raven\" influenced a number of French authors and composers, such as Charles Baudelaire and Maurice Ravel, and it has been suggested that Ravel's Bol\u00e9ro may have been deeply influenced by \"The Philosophy of Composition\".[71]\nThe name of the Baltimore Ravens, a professional American football team, was inspired by the poem.[72][73] Chosen in a fan contest that drew 33,288 voters, the allusion honors Poe, who spent the early part of his career in Baltimore and is buried there.[74]\nThe mantel of the room in which Poe penned \"The Raven\" was removed and donated to Columbia University before the demolition of the Brennan Farmhouse. It currently resides at the Rare Book & Manuscript Library, on the sixth floor of Butler Library.[75]\nSee also\n[edit]- Allusions to Poe's \"The Raven\"\n- Cultural depictions of ravens\n- \"Lenore\", an earlier poem by Poe\n- Mortimer and Arabel, a book series by Joan Aiken and a literary nod to \"The Raven\"\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ a b c Meyers, 163\n- ^ a b c d e Silverman, 239\n- ^ a b c Kopley & Hayes, 192\n- ^ a b c d Silverman, 237\n- ^ \"Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore \u2013 Works \u2013 Poems \u2013 The Raven\".

When the base case is reached, the function begins to return values, and the stack is unwound.\n\n### Example:\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:  # Base case\n        return 1\n    else:       # Recursive case\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\n### Advantages:\n- **Simplicity**: Recursive solutions can be more straightforward and elegant for certain problems (e.g., tree traversals, divide-and-conquer algorithms).\n- **Readability**: Often easier to understand than iterative versions, especially for problems with nested or hierarchical structures.\n\n### Disadvantages:\n- **Performance**: Recursive functions can be less efficient than their iterative counterparts due to the overhead of function calls.\n- **Stack Overflow**: If the base case is not properly defined or the recursion depth is too large, it can lead to a stack overflow error.\n\n### Common Use Cases:\n- Traversing tree or graph structures.\n- Algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and binary search.\n- Mathematical problems such as factorial, Fibonacci sequence, and permutations.\n\nRecursion is a powerful tool in a programmer's toolkit, but it requires careful design to avoid common pitfalls."

This correlation persists regardless of the distance between the particles, which leads to what Einstein famously referred to as \"spooky action at a distance.\"\n\nKey characteristics of quantum entanglement include:\n\n1. **Non-locality**: The state of one entangled particle is instantly correlated with the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. 2. **Superposition**: Entangled particles exist in a superposition of states until measured. 3. **Measurement**: When one particle is measured, the state of the other is instantly determined, even if it is far away. 4. **Applications**: Quantum entanglement is a foundational concept in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation. **What I don't know:**\n\nI do not have access to specific experimental data, detailed theoretical models, or recent advancements in quantum entanglement research beyond what is generally known in the field. For example, I do not have detailed knowledge of:\n\n- The exact mechanisms of how entanglement is created or maintained. - The full implications of entanglement in quantum field theory or quantum gravity. - The latest experimental results or proposed technologies that leverage entanglement for practical applications. - The philosophical or interpretational debates surrounding entanglement (e.g., the many-worlds interpretation, hidden variables, etc.). If you have specific questions or need more detailed information on any of these topics, I can provide a general overview or direct you to relevant resources. Let me know how I can assist further!"
